          <p class="recipe-story">
            Amma’s Neapolitan Cake Pops are a true labor of love. She took the Neapolitan layered cake I made, which was already decadent and dreamy with layers of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry, and turned it into something even more magical.  
            <br><br>
            She carefully crumbled the cake, mixed it with frosting, and rolled it into little cake balls. After dipping them in chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry coatings, she created these adorable, bite-sized treats. They were like little bites of joy, each pop a perfect blend of creamy, sweet, and nostalgic flavors.  
            <br><br>
            Every time I see a cake pop now, I remember Amma’s creativity in transforming what was just a regular cake into something even more special. It was like she added her own sprinkle of love to each one.

          <h2 class="recipe-name">Burmese Tea Leaf Salad</h2>
          <p class="recipe-story">
            Amma’s Burmese Tea Leaf Salad is one of those dishes that’s as unforgettable as it is unique. I remember the first time she made it—my curiosity was piqued by the tangy, earthy smell of the fermented tea leaves she carefully mixed into the salad.  
            <br><br>
            The salad itself is a beautiful medley of textures and flavors: crunchy peanuts, toasted sesame seeds, and dried shrimp all come together with the bold, fermented tea leaves that bring an unexpected depth of flavor. It’s one of those dishes where every bite feels like a new discovery—each ingredient adding its own little surprise to the mix.  
            <br><br>
            Amma’s version is always the best, though. She has this way of balancing all the ingredients so that no one flavor overpowers the rest. It’s savory, tangy, and a little bit spicy—absolutely perfect for when you want to try something different, but comforting at the same time. It’s a dish that brings us all together, sharing bites and stories at the table.

          <h2 class="recipe-name">Nanaimo Bars</h2>
          <p class="recipe-story">
            My mother’s Nanaimo bars are a special treat she makes just for my brother, who’s always had a love for all things Canada. Every time she makes them, it’s a little reminder of how much she knows him and his quirky love for Canadian culture. These no-bake, layered bars are a perfect balance of sweetness and crunch, with a decadent chocolatey top layer, a rich custard filling, and a crunchy coconut base. My brother absolutely loves them, and it’s always a big hit whenever we have them around. They’ve become a fun tradition in our house—whenever my brother’s craving something sweet, you can bet my mom will be in the kitchen making Nanaimo bars!

  <div class="recipe-content">
    <h2 class="recipe-name">Japanese Birthday Cake</h2>
    <p class="recipe-story">
      Every year for my dad’s birthday, my mom makes her signature Japanese cake—and this year’s looked perfect, just like all her desserts do. Light, fluffy, and finished with fresh cream and almonds, it was the centerpiece of a true multicultural feast.  
      <br><br>
      My cousin brought authentic baklava straight from Greece, flaky and soaked in just the right amount of honey, and my uncle showed up with a box of ladoos from India—except these weren’t just any ladoos. In my opinion, they were better than the regular kind—extra soft, with just the right warmth of cardamom.  
      <br><br>
      And as always, there was ice cream. So I grabbed a glass, poured in some root beer, and made myself a classic float. Somehow, it all worked together—just like our family does.

  <div class="recipe-content">
    <h2 class="recipe-name">Amma's Dosa Breakfast</h2>
    <p class="recipe-story">
      Amma’s dosa breakfasts are legendary. Her <strong>masala dosa</strong> is filled with warm spiced potatoes, and her <strong>egg dosa</strong> is perfectly thick and golden — each one soft, tender, and just right.  
      <br><br>
      Every dosa comes with her bright, flavorful <strong>chutney</strong> and warm, cozy <strong>sambar</strong>. Honestly, her sambar is the <strong>only</strong> dish where I actually enjoy carrots — she makes them taste amazing.  
      <br><br>
      Even on Thanksgiving mornings, this spread fills the house with that irresistible aroma, making it one of my favorite ways to start the day.
