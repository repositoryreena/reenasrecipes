      <div class="restaurant-content">
        <h2 class="restaurant-name">Eataly - San Jose</h2>
        <p class="restaurant-story">
            Eataly is like a giant Italian playground—cheese counters, pasta stations, wine bars, and more. I wandered around wide-eyed for way too long before finally settling down for a burrata pizza.  
            <br><br>
            Let me just say… that burrata was living its best life. Creamy, cool, and sitting proudly on top of a hot, bubbly crust with just the right amount of char. Every bite was basically a hug from an Italian grandmother I’ve never met. It was the kind of pizza that makes you sit back, close your eyes, and just *feel* something.

        <p class="restaurant-story">
            My dad got me breakfast and told me I could order anything I wanted, so I decided to go all out. I ordered the large breakfast from Pulp Fiction, complete with buttermilk pancakes and a slice of blueberry pie.

      <div class="restaurant-content">
        <h2 class="restaurant-name">Rangoli – San Jose</h2>
        <p class="restaurant-story">
            My aunt took me to Rangoli one afternoon, and it felt like a mini feast. We ordered garlic naan, stuffed naan, paneer, and a veggie dish to share—and honestly, everything hit.  
            <br><br>
            But the **stuffed naan**? That was the star. Fluffy, warm, buttery, and packed with spiced goodness inside—it was the kind of bread that makes you forget about everything else on the table. I ate *most* of it on my own (hey, no shame in my naan game), and it was absolutely worth every bite.  
            <br><br>
            The whole meal felt like comfort food with a little flair. Definitely one of those places I’d go back to when I want to feel full, happy, and naan-satisfied.

      <div class="restaurant-content">
        <h2 class="restaurant-name">Merit Vegetarian Restaurant - Sunnyvale</h2>
        <p class="restaurant-story">
            Merit Vegetarian is a little gem I found near my singing lesson spot, and it ended up being the perfect place for my 30th birthday dinner. My parents took me there to celebrate, and the food was so good, I’ve decided to make it a birthday tradition from now on. Since I’m vegetarian, it felt really special to have so many delicious East Asian options that fit my lifestyle without compromise. I ordered the vegan fish and chips, vegan orange chicken, and even treated myself to a root beer float. Everything was flavorful, comforting, and just the right amount of fun—it felt like such a treat. Can’t wait to go back next year!

          <p class="restaurant-story">
            We ordered food from Tarah Thai to celebrate my cousin’s 30th birthday, and it was the perfect choice for the occasion. Everything was super flavorful and satisfying—classic Thai comfort food done right. It made the celebration feel extra cozy and delicious, with all the vibrant flavors we love. Sharing takeout around the table, chatting, and celebrating another milestone made it such a fun and memorable night.

          <p class="recipe-story">
            My aunt took me to Aqui and treated me to two delicious things, but the real standout was the goat cheese quesadilla with aioli sauce—it was amazing. The creamy goat cheese paired perfectly with the crispy tortilla, and that aioli sauce brought everything together in the best way. It was such a thoughtful outing, and the food totally hit the spot. I’ll definitely be going back for that quesadilla again.

          <p class="recipe-story">
            For my 30th birthday, I celebrated with dinner at Amber Indian Restaurant in Los Altos, and it was absolutely perfect. I ordered the malai kofta, which was rich, creamy, and full of flavor, paired with the softest stuffed naan that was just the right amount of buttery and crispy. To top it all off, I indulged in gulab jamun with mango ice cream for dessert—it was the perfect sweet ending to an already amazing meal. Such a memorable way to celebrate a milestone birthday!

    <h2 class="restaurant-name">Shosha – Downtown Sunnyvale</h2>
    <p class="restaurant-story">
      My ex-boyfriend took me to Shosha—whose name means "show"—and ordered pani puri shots, Indian dal, and garlic naan. The pani puri was totally chaotic—I nearly choked on the spice—but we laughed through it. He started to take a bite of one, and I had to tell him to put the whole thing in his mouth. He had two of the same color shot, so I ended up with two of the brown ones, which were the best. The dal and naan were warm and comforting, and the whole meal felt like something between a dare and a hug.

    <p class="restaurant-story">
      I went to Verve every day for breakfast and got the same hot chocolate every time. I posted a photo of it every day too. There was something comforting about the ritual—the fancy cup, the foam art, the way it made my whole morning feel steady.

      My ex-boyfriend took me to Evvia while we were dating. We only ordered grape leaves that night—simple but unforgettable. The flavors were rich and bright, and sharing that small dish made the evening feel special in its quiet way.

      Sweet Gelato is this charming boba and ice cream spot in San Jose where I love to go for a sweet treat. They have the cutest small dog that hangs out there and sometimes gets to eat ice cream—seeing that little face light up makes every visit feel extra special.
