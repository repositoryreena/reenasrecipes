      <div class="restaurant-content">
        <h2 class="restaurant-name">Eataly - San Jose</h2>
        <p class="restaurant-story">
            Eataly is like a giant Italian playground—cheese counters, pasta stations, wine bars, and more. I wandered around wide-eyed for way too long before finally settling down for a burrata pizza.  
            <br><br>
            Let me just say… that burrata was living its best life. Creamy, cool, and sitting proudly on top of a hot, bubbly crust with just the right amount of char. Every bite was basically a hug from an Italian grandmother I’ve never met. It was the kind of pizza that makes you sit back, close your eyes, and just *feel* something.

        <p class="restaurant-story">
            My dad got me breakfast and told me I could order anything I wanted, so I decided to go all out. I ordered the large breakfast from Pulp Fiction, complete with buttermilk pancakes and a slice of blueberry pie.

        <h2 class="restaurant-name">Rangoli – San Jose</h2>
        <p class="restaurant-story">
            My aunt took me to Rangoli one afternoon, and it felt like a mini feast. We ordered garlic naan, stuffed naan, paneer, and a veggie dish to share—and honestly, everything hit.  
            <br><br>
            But the **stuffed naan**? That was the star. Fluffy, warm, buttery, and packed with spiced goodness inside—it was the kind of bread that makes you forget about everything else on the table. I ate *most* of it on my own (hey, no shame in my naan game), and it was absolutely worth every bite.  
            <br><br>
            The whole meal felt like comfort food with a little flair. Definitely one of those places I’d go back to when I want to feel full, happy, and naan-satisfied.

        <h2 class="restaurant-name">Merit Vegetarian Restaurant - Sunnyvale</h2>
        <p class="restaurant-story">
            Merit Vegetarian is a little gem I found near my singing lesson spot, and it ended up being the perfect place for my 30th birthday dinner. My parents took me there to celebrate, and the food was so good, I’ve decided to make it a birthday tradition from now on. Since I’m vegetarian, it felt really special to have so many delicious East Asian options that fit my lifestyle without compromise. I ordered the vegan fish and chips, vegan orange chicken, and even treated myself to a root beer float. Everything was flavorful, comforting, and just the right amount of fun—it felt like such a treat. Can’t wait to go back next year!

          <p class="restaurant-story">
            We ordered food from Tarah Thai to celebrate my cousin’s 30th birthday, and it was the perfect choice for the occasion. Everything was super flavorful and satisfying—classic Thai comfort food done right. It made the celebration feel extra cozy and delicious, with all the vibrant flavors we love. Sharing takeout around the table, chatting, and celebrating another milestone made it such a fun and memorable night.

          <p class="recipe-story">
            My aunt took me to Aqui and treated me to two delicious things, but the real standout was the goat cheese quesadilla with aioli sauce—it was amazing. The creamy goat cheese paired perfectly with the crispy tortilla, and that aioli sauce brought everything together in the best way. It was such a thoughtful outing, and the food totally hit the spot. I’ll definitely be going back for that quesadilla again.

          <p class="recipe-story">
            For my 30th birthday, I celebrated with dinner at Amber Indian Restaurant in Los Altos, and it was absolutely perfect. I ordered the malai kofta, which was rich, creamy, and full of flavor, paired with the softest stuffed naan that was just the right amount of buttery and crispy. To top it all off, I indulged in gulab jamun with mango ice cream for dessert—it was the perfect sweet ending to an already amazing meal. Such a memorable way to celebrate a milestone birthday!

    <h2 class="restaurant-name">Shosha – Downtown Sunnyvale</h2>
    <p class="restaurant-story">
      My ex-boyfriend took me to Shosha—whose name means "show"—and ordered pani puri shots, Indian dal, and garlic naan. The pani puri was totally chaotic—I nearly choked on the spice—but we laughed through it. He started to take a bite of one, and I had to tell him to put the whole thing in his mouth. He had two of the same color shot, so I ended up with two of the brown ones, which were the best. The dal and naan were warm and comforting, and the whole meal felt like something between a dare and a hug.

    <p class="restaurant-story">
      I went to Verve every day for breakfast and got the same hot chocolate every time. I posted a photo of it every day too. There was something comforting about the ritual—the fancy cup, the foam art, the way it made my whole morning feel steady.

    <p class="restaurant-story">
      My ex-boyfriend took me to Evvia while we were dating. We only ordered grape leaves that night—simple but unforgettable. The flavors were rich and bright, and sharing that small dish made the evening feel special in its quiet way.

    <h2 class="restaurant-name">Sweet Gelato – San Jose</h2>
    <p class="restaurant-story">
      Sweet Gelato is this charming boba and ice cream spot in San Jose where I love to go for a sweet treat. They have the cutest small dog that hangs out there and sometimes gets to eat ice cream—seeing that little face light up makes every visit feel extra special.

  <div class="restaurant-content">
    <h2 class="restaurant-name">Tea+Pot – Palo Alto</h2>
    <p class="restaurant-story">
      We went to Tea+Pot for my cousin’s birthday, and it was an experience—raw meat, bubbling broth, and everyone cooking their own hot pot at the table. My mom nailed the order for me: spring rolls, tofu (which turned out to be the best dish of the night), and a mango sago that was sweet and refreshing.  
      <br><br>
      For dessert, we got sesame balls—and my cousin kept hoarding them under her napkin like a little dessert dragon. Somehow, the night ended poetically: I wandered over to Spoon and got myself a scoop of black sesame ice cream. From tofu to toasted sesame, it was a night of cozy, savory-sweet perfection.

<div class="restaurant-card">

  <div class="restaurant-content">
    <h2 class="restaurant-name">Willow Glen Creamery – San Jose</h2>
    <p class="restaurant-story">
      My cousin and I went to Willow Glen Creamery on a whim and ended up with vanilla custard frozen yogurt topped with cookie dough. It was cool, creamy, and exactly what we didn’t know we needed.  
      <br><br>
      But the real flavor came from a little sign behind the counter that said, “Your mother didn’t give birth to you so you could order vanilla.” Naturally, we laughed and ordered vanilla anyway—rebellion never tasted so soft-serve sweet.  
      <br><br>
      The whole place felt like summer in a cup, with a side of sass. 10/10 would commit frozen yogurt treason again.

  <div class="restaurant-content">
    <h2 class="restaurant-name">The Garret – Campbell</h2>
    <p class="restaurant-story">
      The Garret is one of those cozy, no-frills pizza spots where the food speaks for itself. I went for a vegetarian pizza, and it completely delivered—loaded with fresh toppings, melty cheese, and a perfectly baked crust.  
      <br><br>
      The mushrooms? Let’s just say, mushrooms may not always be my thing, but on this pizza they belonged. It’s the one place where they go from “meh” to *must-have*. Every bite reminded me why pizza nights here are always worth it.

  <div class="restaurant-content">
    <h2 class="restaurant-name">Nirvanaah! Ice Cream – Sunnyvale</h2>
    <p class="restaurant-story">
      Nirvanaah! is basically dessert heaven—an Indian ice cream shop with every flavor you can think of, from classics like mango and pistachio to unique Indian favorites you don’t see anywhere else.  
      <br><br>
      I treated myself to a **falooda kulfi milkshake**, and it was a total experience: sweet, creamy, nutty, with just the right hint of rose and vermicelli for texture. I also tried a **Ferrero Rocher milkshake**, and it was just as decadent—rich, chocolatey, and perfectly blended with that hazelnut crunch.  
      <br><br>
      Between the two, it felt like both comfort and luxury in milkshake form. Definitely the kind of place that makes you want to come back just to try every flavor on the menu.

  <div class="restaurant-content">
    <h2 class="restaurant-name">Peet's Coffee – Dubai Chocolate Milk</h2>
    <p class="restaurant-story">
      Peet’s Dubai Chocolate Milk was one of those drinks that instantly earned a spot in my rotation. It tasted like chocolate milk that grew up, traveled the world, and came back with stories—rich, smooth, and just a little dramatic.  
      <br><br>
      It had the kind of deep chocolate flavor that doesn’t rush; it settles in, slow and confident, with a sweetness that feels intentional instead of sugary. The whole thing felt luxurious without even trying.  
      <br><br>
      If regular chocolate milk is comfort, this one was confidence. Definitely one of the best things I’ve ever ordered from Peet’s.

  <div class="restaurant-content">
    <h2 class="restaurant-name">Ferrell’s Donuts – Santa Cruz</h2>
    <p class="restaurant-story">
      Ferrell’s Donuts was one of those spontaneous Santa Cruz stops that instantly paid off. I ordered a raspberry-filled chocolate donut, and it was everything I wanted—rich chocolate on the outside, soft and fluffy inside, with that bright raspberry filling cutting through the sweetness perfectly.  
      <br><br>
      It was messy in the best way, the kind of donut you have to fully commit to. Standing there with powdered fingers and chocolate smudges, it felt like a small, perfect moment—simple, indulgent, and very Santa Cruz.

    <h2 class="restaurant-name">Paris Baguette – Christmas Morning Tradition</h2>
    <p class="restaurant-story">
      Paris Baguette on Christmas morning has become a tradition. That day, I picked out a snowman donut topped with white chocolate and filled with cream — festive, adorable, and absolutely excessive.  
      <br><br>
      It was rich and sweet and filling in that way where you know you should stop, but don’t. By the end, I was sickeningly full, sugar-dazed, and completely satisfied.  
      <br><br>
      It felt like Christmas should feel: indulgent, a little ridiculous, and very worth it.

  <div class="restaurant-content">
    <h2 class="restaurant-name">Square Pie Guys – Detroit Deep Dish</h2>
    <p class="restaurant-story">
      Square Pie Guys makes Detroit deep dish pizza that feels almost architectural. Thick, crisp-edged, and perfectly square, it’s a nice geometric shape that somehow makes the pizza feel even more satisfying.  
      <br><br>
      The crust is sturdy but soft inside, the cheese caramelized along the edges, and every slice feels intentional — like it was designed instead of just baked.  
      <br><br>
      I was fully committed to finishing the whole thing myself, but my dad took a small piece before I could. Even then, I still managed to eat the rest — proof that this pizza is both filling and impossible to resist.

      Boba Guys’ Thai tea is one of those drinks that never disappoints. Smooth, creamy, and perfectly balanced, it has that deep tea flavor without being too sweet or heavy.  
      <br><br>
      It’s comforting and familiar, the kind of drink you come back to when you want something reliable and grounding.  
      <br><br>
      Every sip feels like a reset — simple, steady, and exactly what you hoped it would be.
